# Phone Number Entry With UNO

## What is this?

This is an experiment of bad UX. Fun bad UX. But bad UX nonetheless. 

You can see my creation at:

## Why did you do it?

I was inspired by the minds at https://reddit.com/r/badUIbattles to think what's the worst way to enter a phone number in a form. I hate UNO and I am apparently pretty close to being a masochist so I'd say one thing led to another.

## So is this a game?
I suppose so, but in the countless times I "played" it while developing, I wasn't able to win it.
